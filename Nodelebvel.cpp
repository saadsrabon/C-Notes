// Problem statement
// Ninja has been given a binary tree having N nodes and an integer M, he needs to find the level of node M. He finds it difficult to solve and asks for your help.

// Note:

// Consider root to be at level 1. It is guaranteed that all the nodes in the binary tree have distinct values.
// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Constraints:
// 1 <= T <= 5
// 0 <= N <= 3000
// 0 <= node data <= 10^9  

// Time Limit: 1 sec
// Sample Input 1:
// 2
// 1 2 3 -1 -1 -1  6 -1 -1
// 6
// 1 2 -1 -1 -1
// 1
// Sample Output 1:
// 3
// 1
// Explanation of Sample Input 1:
//  For the first test case, the given binary tree is shown below.
